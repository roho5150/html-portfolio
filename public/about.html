<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Eugene Roberts. I am a passionate web developer <br> with experience in creating responsive and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>
  I have a strong background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code. <br>
  In my free time, I love exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and enhancing my skills. <br>
  When I'm not coding, you can find me fishing, doing woodworking, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
